# Watchlist-based face morphing attack detection and attacker identification database

## Introduction

The watchlist-based face morphing attack detection and attacker identification database (henceforth, ''database'') contains images used for the detection of morphing attacks. To foster the research of face morphing attack detection, the database will be released to researchers for academic research purpose upon request.

Some images of the database are shown below, the black boxes are used for privacy concerns but are not used in the experiments. (a) Bona fide image of subject 1. (b) Complete morphed image [1]. (c) Splicing morphed image [1]. (d) Retouching morphed image [2]. (e) Combined morphed image [3]. (f) Bona fide image of subject 2. The morphing weight $ \alpha $ is 0.5.
